<p>It is repository of Machine Learning classification project of Heart disease prediction. In this project I have used machine learning Classification Algorithm like Logistic Regression, Random Forest ,KNN etc, for Training And Testing Purpose I have used heart Disease Dataset which is present on UCI MACHINE LEARNING REPOSITORY  as well as kaggle.</p>
